/**
 * File: src/_util/grid.ts
 * Module: Game Logic – Board & Cell Utilities
 * Brief: Defines the Cell type and provides core helpers for Minesweeper:
 *        board creation, mine placement (with first-click safety exclusion),
 *        adjacency computation, flood-fill reveal, and immutable cloning.
 *
 * Inputs:
 *   - Function-specific inputs documented below (rows/cols, mine count, board, etc.)
 * Outputs:
 *   - Returns board matrices or mutates provided board in-place (as noted per function)
 *
 * Side Effects:
 *   - Several helpers intentionally mutate the passed-in board (documented per function).
 *
 * External Sources / Attribution:
 *   - None;

 *
 * EECS 581 – Project 1 Compliance Notes:
 *   - Supports a fixed 10×10 grid at call-sites; user-selected mines 10–20.
 *   - First click safety: `placeMines` excludes the initially clicked cell and its neighbors.
 *   - `computeAdjacency` assigns 0–8 counts; `floodFill` expands when count is 0.
 *

 * Creation Date: 2025-09-09
 * Course: EECS 581 (Software Engineering II), Prof. Hossein Saiedian – Fall 2025

 * Inputs:

 * Outputs:

 * Notes:
 *   - Ensures uniqueness (no duplicate placement).
 *   - Exclusion: any (r,c) where |r-exclude.r| ≤ 1 and |c-exclude.c| ≤ 1.
 *   - Loop continues until requested mine count is placed; guaranteed to terminate
 *     for the project’s 10×10 board with 10–20 mines.
